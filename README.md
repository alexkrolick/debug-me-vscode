# debug-me-vscode

A playground for practicing debugging with Visual Studio Code.

## Install

```bash
cd backend && yarn install
cd ..
cd frontend && yarn install
```

## Run

**With VSCode:** Open the Tasks menu and run "Frontend dev server" and "Backend dev server" from the menu.

**Command line:** `yarn dev` in both directories

## Debug

There are two branches that contain bugs: `frontend-bug` and `backend-bug`. Check one out and open VSCode.

Open the VSCode Debug (~`🐞`~) panel and press ▶️ for Frontend or Backend. Add breakpoints throughout the app by clicking in the gutter.
